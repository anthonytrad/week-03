					<p>After downloading the theme from Themeforest, you need to unzip it, and you should see the following structure:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Demo</strong> – contains the demo data XML file.</li>
						<li><strong>Documentation</strong> – the theme documentation in PDF format.</li>
						<li><strong>thewall.zip</strong> – the zipped theme (this will be the file you will upload to install the theme).</li>
						<li><strong>Assets</strong> – the theme’s PSD files.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					
					<h3>Installing the theme</h3>
					<p>
					We will assume your site has WordPress already installed. If you need help installing WordPress, you can find detailed instructions in <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress" target="_blank">WordPress’ codex page</a>. Once your site is ready, we can begin installing The Wall.
					</p>
					<ul class="steps">
						<li>On your WordPress administrator, navigate to <em>Appareance > Themes</em>.</li>
						<li>Click on <strong>Add New</strong> and then click <strong>Upload</strong>.</li>
						<li>Choose the <strong>thewall.zip</strong> file (the one that’s inside the folder where you uncompressed the The Wall file you downloaded), and upload it.</li> 
						<li>Now click on <strong>Install Now</strong>. If all goes well, this process shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, depending on the speed of your internet connection. Once the theme is installed, you should see this message: <em>Theme installed successfully</em>.</li> 
						<li>Now click the <strong>Activate</strong> button.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>And that’s it! The Wall is now installed, activated and ready to use!</p>
					
					<h3>Installing the required plugins</h3>
					<p>The Wall requires you to install some plugins in order to work. But luckily this is very easy to do!</p>
					
					<p>After you activated The Wall, you should see this message on the top of your WordPress admin page:</p>
					<ul style="display: block; border-left: 4px solid #7ad03a; padding: 12px;">
						<li><strong>This theme requires the following plugins:</strong> <em>Explora Widgets, Explora Types and Explora Metaboxes.</em></li>
						<li><strong>This theme recommends the following plugins:</strong> <em> Contact Form 7, I Recommend This ans WPBackery Visual Composer.</em></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					Themes are not supposed to provide extra functionality, so all the awesome features The Wall offers need to be separated from the theme. This is why we provide this functionality in the form of plugins, which need to be manually installed by you. To do this, simply follow the instructions below.
					</p>
					<ul class="steps">
						<li>Click the <strong>Begin installing</strong> plugins link.</li>
						<li>On the screen that appears, you will see <strong>Install</strong> buttons for all the bundled plugins. Install the required plugins and the recommended ones that you want.</li>
						<li>Just like the theme itself, the plugins need to be activated also. The <strong>Install</strong> buttons should have disappeared, and there should be <strong>Activate</strong> buttons instead. Just activate all the plugins you installed and you are good to go!</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div id="page-2" class="page">
					<p>If you have already installed the theme and the required plugins, you can now begin building your site! 
    The Wall is a really simple theme so luckily there's not much to learn about it if you are familiar with WordPress.</p>

					<h3>Main steps</h3>
					
					<section>
						<h4>Add content</h4>
						<p>You should begin by adding content to your site. In this documentation you can find instructions to create each of the different pages The Wall supports, and to create blog posts and albums as well.</p>
						<p>Alternatively, you can import the demo data from The Wall's demo site. To do that, please see: <em>Importing the demo data</em>. Please note that you will still need to create your Homepage manually, and that the images are not included due to copyright limitations.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
					    <h4>Create a Main Menu</h4>
					    <p>Just create a regular WordPress menu, and make sure you set the <em>Main Menu</em> theme location.</p>
					    <p class="note">If you don't know how to create a menu in WordPress, please read the following article from the WordPress Codex: <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Menu_User_Guide" target="_blank">WordPress Menu User Guide</a>.</p>
					    <p>To learn how to choose your site's logo and social network links, please see <em>Customization options</em></p>
					</section>
					
					<section>
					    <h4>Customize your site</h4>
					    <p>The Wall includes some customization options that you can use to make your site more unique.</p>
					    <p class="note">To customize your site, use the <em>Customize</em> tool which you can find in <em>Appearance > Customize</em></p>
					    <p>For more information on this subject, check the <em>Customization options</em> section.</p>

					<h3>Creating the homepage</h3>
                    <p>The homepage basically consists of a <em>slider</em> and a <em>wall</em>. To create it, follow the steps below.</p>
                    <ul class="steps">
                        <li>Navigate to <em>Pages > Add New</em>.</li>
                        <li>Choose the <em>Homepage</em> template from the <em>Template</em> select on the <em>Page Attributes</em> box.</li>
                        <li>Enter a title for the page and click <em>Publish</em>.</li>
                        <li> Now you need to set page as the Front Page. To do this, navigate to <em>Appearance > Reading</em> and set the <em>Front page displays</em> option to <em>A static page</em>. Then select your homepage on the <em>Front page</em> field.
And that’s it! Now you just need to create your homepage’s gallery and you are all set.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now that you have created your homepage, you can create its slider and wall.</p>
                    <h3>Creating the Homepage's Slider</h3>
                    <p>After clicking the <em>Publish</em> button, a Homepage Slider box will appear. The first two options that you will see are Slideshow and Interval. This allows you to define wether the slider will animate automatically or not, and the interval of time each slide will be visible.</p>
                    <p>Below, you will see an empty list of slides. Click the camera icon to add an image to a slide (on the Add Media popup that will appear, use the Insert into post button to set the image). You can also set a Title, Description, Link and Date to the slide. Also, you can set the Image Display option, which allows you to decide wether the Cover or Contain methods will be used to display the photo on the slider. The Cover method makes sure the photo covers the entire viewscreen, even if a portion of the image needs to be cropped, while the Contain option makes sure the picture is not cropped at all.</p>
                    <h3>Creating the Homepage's Wall</h3>
                    <p>Creating your wall is pretty straightforward. Just use the <strong>Add Gallery</strong>, <strong>Add Album</strong>, <strong>Add Blog Post</strong> and <strong>Add Text Block</strong> buttons to add modules to the wall. Then you can rearrange them by dragging and dropping the modules with your mouse.</p>
                    
				</div>
                
                <div id="page-4" class="page">
					<h3>Blog Page</h3>
                    <p>This is the page where your blog posts will be featured. To create it, simply follow the instructions below.</p>
                    <ul class="steps">
                        <li>Navigate to <strong>Pages > Add New</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Enter a title for the page (for example: “Blog”) and click <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Now you need to set page as the Posts Page. To do this, navigate to <strong>Appearance > Reading</strong> and set
the <strong>Front page displays</strong> option to <strong>A static page</strong>. Then select your blog page on the <strong>Posts page</strong> field.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can now begin adding Blog Posts to your site.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="page-5" class="page">
					<h3>Custom Pages</h3>
                    <p>Custom pages are multi purpose pages that can be used for displaying any kind of content on your site. Follow the instructions below to create one.</p>
                    <ul class="steps">
                        <li>Navigate to <strong>Pages > Add New</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Enter a title for the page and click <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now you can begin adding content to your page using the Visual Composer editor. If you need help using the Visual Composer plugin, head to the plugin’s <a href="https://wpbakery.atlassian.net/wiki/display/VC/Visual%2BComposer%2BPagebuilder%2Bfor%2BWordPress">knowledge base</a>.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="page-6" class="page">
					<h3>Contact Page</h3>
                    <p>Contact pages are used to display a page where your site visitors can see your contact information, location map and a contact form so your visitors can contact you. To create a contact page, follow the instructions below.</p>
                    <ul class="steps">
                        <li>Navigate to <strong>Pages > Add New</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Choose the Contact template from the <strong>Template</strong> select on the <strong>Page Attributes</strong> box.</li>
                        <li>Enter a title for the page (for example: “Contact”) and click <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now you need to configure your contact form using the Contact Form plugin. Navigate to the Contact menu item on your WordPress’ administrator. There should be a form already created so you can use that one or create a new one. In any case, here is the code you need to enter in the Form section of your contact form:</p>
                    <p class="note code">
                    &lt;section class=&quot;contact&quot;&gt;<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h2&gt;Leave a Comment&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked &lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p class=&quot;form-name field&quot;&gt;[text* your-name placeholder &quot;NAME&quot;]&lt;/p&gt;<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p class=&quot;form-email field&quot;&gt;[email* your-email placeholder &quot;EMAIL&quot;]&lt;/p&gt;<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p class=&quot;form-web field&quot;&gt;[email* your-email placeholder &quot;WEBSITE&quot;]&lt;/p&gt;<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p class=&quot;form-comment&quot;&gt;[textarea your-message][submit &quot;SEND&quot;]&lt;/p&gt;<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
                    &lt;/section&gt;
                    </p>
                    <p>Now you need to insert the contact form in your contact page. To do this, copy the contact's form shortcode and paste it into your contact page's content. It should look something like this:</p>
                    <p class="note code">[contact-form-7 id=&quot;###&quot; title=&quot;Contact form 1&quot;]</p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="page-8" class="page">
					<h3>Albums</h3>
                    <p>Albums are collections of photos which have their own page and can be featured on the Homepage's Wall. Follow the instructions below to create one.</p>
                    <ul class="steps">
                        <li>Navigate to <strong>Albums > Add New</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Enter a title for the album and click <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now you can begin adding photos and descriptions to your album. Here's the list of fields you have available:</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Headline</dt>
                        <dd>This is the handwritting styled headline that appears on top of your album's title.</dd>
                        <dt>Cover Photo</dt>
                        <dd>This is the cover photo that appears on top of the page.</dd>
                        <dt>Heading Text</dt>
                        <dd>This is the text that appears before the gallery</dd>
                        <dt>Gallery</dt>
                        <dd>This is the album's photo gallery.</dd>
                        <dt>Description</dt>
                        <dd>This is the description that is displayed on the album's sidebar.</dd>
                        <dt>Wall description</dt>
                        <dd>This is an alternative optional description that you can use if you want to have a different description for this album when diplayed on your homepage's wall.</dd>
                        <dt>Album Page layout</dt>
                        <dd>Choose the positioning of your sidebar for this album.</dd>
                        <dt>Gallery Columns</dt>
                        <dd>Choose the number of columns for this album.</dd>
                        <dt>Meta Info</dt>
                        <dd>This is the meta info that is displayed on the album's sidebar.</dd>
                    </dl>
                </div>
				
				<div id="page-9" class="page">
					<h3>Importing the demo data</h3>
					<p>We have included an XML file that allows you to recreate Thw Wall's demo site. If you choose to do this, posts and pages will be created on your site for you. Then you can add or remove the content on your site to fit your needs.</p>
					<ul class="steps">
						<li>To import the demo data, go to <strong>Tools > Import</strong> and choose <strong>WordPress</strong> on the next screen. You may have to install the WordPress importer if you don’t have it already.</li>
						<li>Choose the XML data  file (<strong>thewall_demo.xml</strong>) that’s included in the folder named Demo</li>
						<li>Click on <strong>Upload file and import</strong></li>
						<li>Check the <strong>Download and import</strong> file attachments box</li>
						<li>Click on <strong>Submit</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p class="note">Due to WordPress Importer limitations, the Homepage's content cannot be imported, and you will need to create it manually.</p>
					<p class="note">Please note that as stated on Munich’s product page, the images are not included. We have bought licenses to use the images on our demo site, but we do not have the rights to give them away.</p>
